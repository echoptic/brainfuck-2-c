This is a quick and simple Brainfuck to C compiler.
I don't think that every program works because I don't handle
the overflow of cell going to 256 and -1, but every program 
I tried so far works.
To compile hello_world.b run:
cargo run -- hello_world.b
This will generate out.c file that you can compile with a C compiler(gcc or clang)
and it outputs: Hello, World!
